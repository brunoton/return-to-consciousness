## Abstract

Contemporary philosophy and science face profound challenges that resist solution within purely materialist frameworks: the hard problem of consciousness, quantum mechanics' measurement puzzle, and the integration crisis between scientific and experiential worldviews. This work presents a comprehensive case for consciousness-first metaphysics, building on Bernardo Kastrup's analytic idealism while engaging with quantum physics, anomalous phenomena research, and contemplative traditions spanning cultures and millennia.

**Original Contributions:**
- **Historical Analysis of Materialism's Rise**: Reveals how objective empiricism (successful research methodology) became conflated with metaphysical materialism through conceptual confusion rather than empirical necessity, opening space for consciousness-first alternatives
- **Anomalous Phenomena Integration**: Demonstrates how well-documented phenomena—near-death experiences, terminal lucidity, placebo effects, reincarnation research—become explicable under consciousness-first metaphysics while remaining mysterious under materialism
- **Cross-Cultural Convergence Analysis**: Documents how quantum mechanics pioneers independently arrived at consciousness-oriented interpretations, aligning with insights from contemplative traditions across cultures
- **AI Safety Through Consciousness Maturation**: Reframes artificial intelligence development as requiring human spiritual evolution alongside technical advancement, recognizing fundamental uncertainty about consciousness manifestation in artificial systems

## Significance

As we develop artificial intelligence and confront civilizational challenges that resist purely materialist solutions, our metaphysical foundations become practically urgent. This framework suggests that meaning is inherent rather than constructed, that nature participates in awareness, and that technology development requires wisdom alongside capability.

*"We stand at a threshold. The materialist worldview that seemed to promise unlimited progress has revealed its shadows... Yet within this crisis, ancient wisdom converges with cutting-edge philosophy to offer an alternative: consciousness as the fundamental nature of reality."*
